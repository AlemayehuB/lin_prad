Two-blob verification test for field reconstruction.

The file 'blob.out.gz' uncompresses to a 2.5GB file containing 10 million
simulated protons, which have traveled through an interaction region containing
two Gaussian blobs.

Running reconstruct.py on this file created the reconstruction file, called
'blobfield.out'. Running the plotting utility 'Bplot2.py' created the files 
'B_Reconstructed.png' and 'B_True.png'.
